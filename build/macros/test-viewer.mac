# Set particle as gamma

# Set source position
# Set it in the centre

# Set source momentum direction
# Here we will set it in z direction
/gps/direction 0 0 1

# Set source type
# The angular distribution (/ang) is to control the direction that the particles emanate from
# For a point source, we use isotropic distribution, uniform 4pi flux
# Note: the /ang/type iso (isometric) is the key argument to getting the point source to work
# This is also the default setting

# Set particle energy
# The default energy unit is MeV; need to specify otherwise
