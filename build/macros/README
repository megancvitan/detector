This folder contains the macros. This is how we will specify the type of particle, its associated energies, and how many events to run.

A $ indicates what you need to type into the terminal. 
Example : $./detector1  means type : ./detector1   into the terminal

To run a macro type:

$./detector1 ./macros/test.mac

into terminal while in the /build folder.


###### test-viewer.mac #####

The first test you should run, this macro gives a mono-energetic point source run with visualisation (10 events should run quickly).

To get the viewer to work, you need to first run  $./detector1
The viewer should pop up and then the program will wait for input.
To execute the macro type, do $/control/execute ./macros/test-viewer.mac

This should run 10 monoenergetic events (at 165 keV) towards the detector. You may rotate the viewer to see the events and the detector.

To exit the visualiser type: $exit

Notes on running visualizer:
I would suggest opening the visualizer and running 10 events when doing any changes to geometry of the detector or the source location. Just to be sure that everything is working. However, running anything more than 100 events takes a much larger computing time and is a waste of time. It's better to run macros without visualisation in this case.


##### hist-from-file.mac #####

This macro makes a point source with energy taken from a histogram file that has been written in the format that Geant4 accepts. The format G4 accepts is a file with each point written on a new line. Energy in MeV must be in the first column and intensity must be in the second column with the two columns separated by a space. See Hist-example.dat.


##### Ba-with-background.mac #####

This is probably the most important macro in this folder. This allows you to have two import sources (such as Barium and Background) or whichever two sources you like.

The two most important lines in this macro will be /gps/source/add 1 and /gps/hist/file _____   

/source/add __ takes as input the intensity of the particle. The two intensities are taken as a relative, so if both sources have the same intensity then half of the particles will be source 1 and half source 2.   

If you wanted to have a source with intensity 0 this will not work, instead you must use a very small intensity like 0.0000001

Note: if making a comparison, also change the file name at the bottom of the macro file.

You can change the source to any source that you have made that has a hist file.
